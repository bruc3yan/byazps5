<h1>PC Warehouse Webstore</h1>
<!-- Your application should have a page that asks the user for a price and find the PC whose price is closest to the desired price. Print the maker, model number, and speed of the PC.
As for the user interface, the result page should have a link back to the page asking for a price so that the user can run this query as many times as s/he wants to. Or, if you like, you can group all of these (including the ones below) together onto a single page and add a link that just clears the output-->
<h3> What's the best PC based on price? </h3>
<form action="/byazps5/FindPriceAndPrint">
  Desired price:  <input type="text" name="price" /><br />
